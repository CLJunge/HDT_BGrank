# HDT_BGrank  

This is a plugin for the [HDT](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker), and works in the hearthstone battlegrounds.  

With this plugin, You can get opponents' MMR automatically.  

Here is it looks like:

After a match starts, slip your mouse cursor on everyone's portrait at left,  

and then the MMR information will show up. (you can move the panel by dragging it)  

Since the leaderboard only records the 8000+ MMR players,  

the 8000- MMR players will be shown as 8000↓.  

If there are players with a same name, the highest MMR will be picked.  

**Notice: Sometimes players with 8000+ MMR can't be found in the leaderboard,**  

**so 8000↓ is not 100% accurate.**
